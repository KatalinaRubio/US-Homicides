# US-Homicides

Do you ever wonder why a homicide goes unsolved? Just in 2019, there were 16,425 reported cases of murder or non-negligent manslaughter in the United States. 
According to the US department of justice, our nation currently has 250,000 unsolved homicides, a number that increases by about 6,000 each year. 
There are so many factors police agencies look into when trying to solve a homicide. Our goal of this analysis is to determine what factors tend to increase/decrease 
the likelihood of a homicide going unsolved and to build a model that will predict whether a homicide will be solved or not. 
	
We will be analyzing data from the “Murder Accountability Project” found at http://www.murderdata.org/. The Murder Accountability Project is the most complete 
database of homicides in the United States currently available. This dataset includes murders from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report from 1976 to 2016 and 
Freedom of Information Act data on more than 22,000 homicides that were not reported to the Justice Department. This dataset includes the age, race, sex, ethnicity 
of victims and perpetrators, in addition to the relationship between the victim and perpetrator and weapon used.

With this data, we were able to identify what factors tend to cause a homicide to go unsolved. By analyzing the data, we hypothesized that weapon, location, 
victim age and victim race were good indicators of whether a homicide would go unsolved. After some deep analyzing we then built models to see if our hypothesis 
was correct.
